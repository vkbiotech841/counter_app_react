// First add Simple React Snippet.
// import react : type "imrc"
// create a class : type "cc"
// create a stateless function: type "sfc"

// Reactive lifecycle hooks in order: 
// (1) Mount phase (constructor, render and componentDidMount methods)
// (2) Update phase (render and componentDidUpdate methods)
// (3) Unmount phase (ComponentWillUnmount)
class App extends Component {

  // State: is an object. it is data collection that we want to render.
  // this.setState() : In react, we use this function to update the state object. In angular, we need to update the state. Angular works on self detection function.
  // this.setState function is slowmly response to detecting changes => update to the virtual DOM.

  // MOUNTING PHASE of lifecycle hook: constructor method is called. it is called only once, when the instance of the class is created.
  // super(): called the constructor of the parent component. it is important to call the function the parent component constructor.
  // super() function allow "this" key word to the accessable to the component.

    super();
    console.log('App-Constructor');

  // COMPONENT DID MOUNT PHASE OF LIFECYCLE HOOK: This method is called after component is rendered into the DOM.
  // This is the perfect place for get data from the server (AJAX calls).
  componentDidMount() {
    // Ajax call
    // this.setState({})

  // Render phase of lifecycle hook: Once a component is rendered. their childrens are also rendered recursively.
  // Render is responsible for how UI should look like. 
  // The output of render method is a react element. Which is simple javascript object that map to a DOM element. 
  // Virtual DOM: Since, output of render method is just a plan javascript object. Hence, it is not a real DOM. Hence, it is called virtual DOM.
  // React keep a light weight representation of DOM in the memory. This is called as Virutal DOM.
  // Web browsers have real DOM.

  // React: meaning "Re" + "act".
  // change state => new react element => reacts compares its components and childrens with its previous virtual DOM => Updates the real DOM.

// Difference between state and props: 
// State: stores data those are local or private to the component. Other component can not access state data.
// other component wish to modify the state, the other component need to raise an event (function call).


//Props: wherease props stores data that transfer to the other components (Child). 
// props are read only. it can act as input to the other component but other component can not be change it. 



// THUMB RULE: 
// The component that owns a piece of the state, should be the one who modifying it.
